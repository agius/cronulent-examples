# Todoist Completer

This script checks your current items in [Todoist](https://todoist.com/), and completes any items tagged with `@done` . This makes it easier to enter a bunch of things you just did, without having to go back and check off the items individually. Stay on the keyboard, without having to tap.

You'll need your Todoist API token - get it on [the settings screen on Todoist](https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations).
