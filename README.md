# Cronulent Example Library

This repo contains example cron jobs for you to use, modify, and repurpose. Hopefully they will serve as an inspiration for even more creative ideas. To use one on [Cronulent](https://www.cronulent.com), just copy the code from the relevant `index.js` file and paste it into your project, then modify the variables at the top of the job to use your access tokens, settings and preferences.

If you have a cron job you like, feel free to open a pull request here and share it with the world!
